This is an old common folder for classes that were used by both the limewire core and gui.
Not to be confused with common/ at the root of the project which means a space for common
classes between FrostWire for Android and FrostWire for Desktop.

There's some redundancies, like the IOUtils.java which we need to weed out soon.
